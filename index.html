       <p>It began with a simple click. A friend request that didn’t mean much at the time — just another small moment in a busy day. But sometimes the smallest things change everything.</p>

<p>At first, there were just a few messages. Light, playful, ordinary. But soon, something quiet started to build — a comfort that felt new. They didn’t rush it. No big confessions, no promises. Just talks that went on a little longer each night.</p>

<p>Days turned into months, and the bond deepened. They started to share more — the little fears, the strange dreams, the things they never told anyone else. They laughed at each other’s silly thoughts, argued over small things, and still came back — every time.</p>

<p>There was no need to prove anything. Just being there was enough. Even in silence, they could feel each other’s presence. That’s when they both knew — this wasn’t just talking anymore. It was love.</p>

<p>Not the kind you see in movies, full of drama and noise. This was quiet, steady, and real. The kind that teaches you to be patient, to listen, to grow.</p>

<p>Sometimes life got busy, sometimes distance came in between — but love stayed. It didn’t fade; it changed shape, became softer, deeper. It turned from excitement to peace.</p>

<p>And through all of it, one thing never changed: They still found each other, again and again, like gravity.</p>

<p>Because when it’s real, love doesn’t end. It just learns new ways to stay.</p>

      <p>Every day with you feels like a gift. From that first “Hey” to all the laughs, talks, and quiet moments we’ve shared, you’ve made my world brighter. Thank you for being you — kind, wise, and real. I’m so lucky to call you mine.</p>
