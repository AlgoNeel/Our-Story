    <h1>A Letter to Lokkhi</h1>
    <div class="letter-box">
      <p id="typed" class="typed">My Dearest Lokkhi,</p>
        
        <p>I still smile when I think about how it all started. On 25th May 2025, you sent me a friend request. The next day, 26th May, I texted you first — just a simple “Hey.” And your first reply was, “Are you real or fake?” That one line started everything… who knew such a funny beginning would turn into something so beautiful?</p>

        <p>From that day, you became more than just a name on my screen. You became my mentor, my guide, and slowly, my heart’s favorite person. Then on 17th June, I finally said what I’d been feeling — that I love you.</p>

        <p>Now when I look back, it all feels like fate. You came into my life so unexpectedly, but now I can’t imagine my days without you. Thank you for being my Lokkhi — kind, smart, and mine.</p>

        <p class="signature">Always yours,<br>Swapneel</p>
