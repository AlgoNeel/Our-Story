        <h3>First Connection</h3>
        <time>25th May 2025</time>
        <p>It all started with a friend request. Just a random notification, but somehow it felt different. I didn’t know then that one click would change everything. That day was quiet, simple — yet it became the first page of our story.</p>

        <h3>Proposal Date</h3>
        <time>17th June 2025</time>
        <p>That day still feels fresh in my heart. I finally said what I’d been feeling for weeks — that I love you. My hands were shaking, my heart was racing, but the moment you smiled, everything felt right. That’s the day my world found its peace — in you.</p>
